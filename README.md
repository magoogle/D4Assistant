  2. Belial Chest Opener with Specific, Round-Robin, or, Random boss selection

**The Diablo IV Assistant** automates the process of selecting and opening boss loot chests as well as handling masterworking, enchanting and Kurast Tribute selection. It uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and mouse automation to detect and click the correct options based on the boss you select.
